The application is a part of the deAIS project in which I participated as a research engineer. 
A tomcat server is hosted to visualize maritime traffic thanks to received AIS messages. 
Several PL/pgSQL functions are also provided to transform raw information stocked in PostgreSQL to RDF triples according to a trajectory ontology.
